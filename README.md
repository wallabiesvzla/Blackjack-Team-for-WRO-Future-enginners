## About Us

We are a team of seniors for the next school year, we decide to participe in this competitions since last year our only school team wons the nationals and went to the wolrd robotics olympiad in panama, so we decide to try to emulate the same adventure as them and make this a tradition in our school.
Our names and roles are.
Daniela Texeira.Building and programming ( probably the big boss)
Rodrigo Paolillo. Great programmer and problably the most pragmatical inventor ( and the funny part of the team)
Christian Frendin. One of the best programmer in the school  ( No talkin just coding)

## Materials and components

What is Terreneitor made of? Terreneitor is made of pieces and blocks from the _MINDSTORMS education EV3_ lego set, while also using electrical components, and arduino components.

## Our journey, progress and prototypes

In the beginning of our journey, we had plenty of various and diverse ideas on how to build our robot but eventually it all worked out. When we first started, we did messy sketches and tried a lot of ideas. Here are some of our first sketches and ideas for Terreneitor:

Eventually, with these sketches in mind, we started working on the physical robot. We had high hopes for our first prototype, and the more we worked on it, the more our hopes grew. But, there was a problem, a big one...if you see "First prototype wheels mechanism" (you can find in the `videos` folder) you might think, like us, that it would be super fast on the ground, however when we finally were ready to put it to the test... it failed. The wheels mechanism of this prototype did not work on the ground. We tried to change many things and pieces in this prototype to see if it would help, but all our work was in vain, the mechanism still did not work on the floor. Eventually, we find out the cause... the mechanism didn't work because the dc motor that we were using, eventhogh it was fast, it didn't have enough strength and power to move the gear mechanism (the robot was also really tall and heavy causing the dc motor to be carrying this weight all the time, since it was located on the lower part of it. Let's not forget to comment that, also the mechanism for the direction of the robot did not work out too because the motor couldn't move the mechanism (for a better visual understanding visit the `videos` folder), although that was a minor problem compare to the wheel mechanism problem.

But, not everything went wrong with our first prototype because we also did a circuit for the servomotor and for the wheels, and we had a base (constructed by us with lego). All of this things helped us, along with our previous mistakes, to improve and create our second prototype.

In our second prototype, since we learned from our failures and errors from the past prototype, it didn't had any enormous problem, however, there were still problems to be fixed. We realized that the two dc motors we had weren't working simultaneously, which violated the rules of the WRO 2024 competition and also that, eventhough the mesurements of the robot were good according to the rules, it was still, to big in width, which lead to problems like being too heavy so it went super slow (which you can see in the video "Second prototype on the track" in the `videos` folder). And a third
problem was that when we building this prototype was that it did not direct the robot correctly because the wheels of the front couldn't rotate to either left or right. 

As you can realize by now we had plenty of problems since the beginning, let's gather all of them:

### First prototype:

- The wheels mechanism did not work on the ground
- The direction mechanism did not work
- Heavy
- Tall

### Second prototype:

- The mechanism we were using for the wheels violated the rules of WRO 2024 competition
- Too big in width
- Too heavy
- Slow, due to the two previous problems
- Didn't direct the robot correctly

### Final robot

Journies have downsides and good times, advantages and disavantages. After the first and second prototype you might think that because of all this problems we might give up, but contrary to this hypothesis, we didn't (after all "third time's a charm", right?), instead we improved and our mistakes made us stronger, wiser and smarter. So when we created our final robot, we made sure to not make any of our previous mistakes, being very causious in its construction. Thanks to this, we have a robot that is:

- Light weighted
- Short and thin
- The direction and wheel mechanism do work
- Fast
- Doesn't violate any rules of the WRO 2024 competition.
