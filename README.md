## About Us

We are a team of seniors for the next school year, we decide to participe in this competitions since last year our only school team wons the nationals and went to the wolrd robotics olympiad in panama, so we decide to try to emulate the same adventure as them and make this a tradition in our school.

### Our names and roles are:

-Daniela Texeira.Building and programming ( probably the big boss)

-Rodrigo Paolillo. Great programmer and problably the most pragmatical inventor ( and the funny part of the team)

-Christian Frendin. One of the best programmer in the school  ( No talkin just coding)

## Content

- `Vehicle photos`
- `Sketches & inspirations`
- `Codes`
- `Models`
- `Test results`


## Main Components

We use the default content from the _MINDSTORMS education EV3_ lego set and the expansion, we also use some especifical lego gears that we have in the robo lab of our school. Rigth now we already purchase a pixie cam but we area waiting for it to get to our country

## The language
Our initial idea is to use micropython for ev3 since study a lot of that language last school year, and our 3 members were between the top 5 programmers in python in our school, however we find really challenging to get the pip install command to run in our pc, our coach help us with that and doing the flashing sd card to get the software in the ev3 brick. We spen like 5 days making a code but when we try it we got a critical error in the parameters of 3 commands that belongs to the pybricks library, we spend almost a week doing this with no happy result, so we decide to go with the teacher version of legominstorm to get a similar freedom in the coding. However blocks are not our happy place in the coding procces and we are still facing challenges on this 


### the big rocks in our way:
We face many challenge along this competition, but our main rocks in the way ritgh now and in the past are :





### Final robot

Journies have downsides and good times, advantages and disavantages. After the first and second prototype you might think that because of all this problems we might give up, but contrary to this hypothesis, we didn't (after all "third time's a charm", right?), instead we improved and our mistakes made us stronger, wiser and smarter. So when we created our final robot, we made sure to not make any of our previous mistakes, being very causious in its construction. Thanks to this, we have a robot that is:

- Light weighted
- Short and thin
- The direction and wheel mechanism do work
- Fast
- Doesn't violate any rules of the WRO 2024 competition.
